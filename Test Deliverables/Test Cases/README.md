<h1>Test Cases</h1>

The Test Plan has been created to communicate the test approach to team members. It includes the objectives, application requirements, Assumptions/ risks and approach.  This document will clearly identify what the test deliverables will be and what is deemed in and out of scope.

<h1>1.1 Objectives</h1>
QE Todolist is a web-based application that creates, update, edit, and delete items. This software was built with node js. The team is responsible for testing the application and ensuring it meet the minimum requirements.

 <h1>2 Application requirements</h1>
The initial phase will include all must have requirements. These and any other requirements that get included must all be tested. At the end of the project a tester must be able to implement the following:

* 	Application must be able to deploy in docker
* 	Multiple users should be able to view the shared public todo list (no live updates, only on refresh)
* 	Todo list items should persist after browser refresh
* 	Todo items should not be able to be empty
* 	Should be able to add todo items
* 	Should be able to delete todo items
* 	Should be able to edit todo items




<h1>3 Assumptions /Risks</h1>
One of the risks in our project is that data is not being stored after adding a list.

 <h1>4 Test Approach </h1>
The project is using an agile approach, with weekly iterations. At the end of each week the requirements identified for that iteration will be delivered to the team and will be tested
Exploratory testing will play a huge role of the testing since I have never used this type of tool and will be learning as the process moves forward. Functional Testing will also be carried out during the testing of the software.
 <h1>4.1 Test Automation/ Manual Testing </h1>
Both manual and Automation Testing will be performed.
<h1>5 Test Environment  </h1>
A server is required for web server. The application will be tested on windows operating system and it will run on Google chrome.
 <h1> 6. Major Deliverables</h1>
